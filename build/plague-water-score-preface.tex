    \paragraph{Baritone Saxophone}

    Cross-shaped noteheads indicate key-clicks.

    \paragraph{Electric Guitar}

    The electric guitar should be treated with 6 different colors, via effects
    pedal(s). The color to be used is indicated at the beginning of each
    section of the score.  Pedal colors may include any combination of
    distortion, reverb or short delay (less than a quarter second).  A volume
    pedal should be placed last in the effect chain, to control overall
    dynamic.

    \paragraph{Piano}

    Cross-shaped noteheads indicate glissandi on the tops of the keys, without
    depressing the keys, played with the flesh of the fingers, or fingernails.
    A flat or natural sign above the glissandi determines whether to play on
    the black or white keys.

    \paragraph{Percussion}
    
    Instrumentation is somewhat up to the discretion of the performer, but
    should obey the following guidelines:

    \begin{itemize}
        
        \item \emph{4 wooden shakers}, bamboo wind-chimes, maracas, rainsticks,
        cabasa, etc. These can include metallic timbres (for example, if a
        cabasa is used), but should be primarily wood. The order of the shakers
        is not important.  Instruments with a longer decay, and a more granular
        sound quality, such as rainsticks and bamboo windchimes are preferred.

        \item \emph{5 wood blocks}, arranged from lowest to highest.  The
        exact pitch is not important. These could also be temple blocks. The
        sound quality should be very dry.

        \item \emph{3 large drums}, including at least one proper bass drum,
        arranged from lowest to highest.

    \end{itemize}

    Performance implements consist of hard mallets (for the wood blocks), and
    soft mallets, super-balls, stiff paintbrushes or wire brushes (whichever is
    louder), and styrofoam blocks for the bass drums. The wooden shakers may be
    played with the hand, or excited with mallets, as convenient.\\

    Percussion grace notes may be played in any manner.
